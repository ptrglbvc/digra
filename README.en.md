# Digra

This React application facilitates the conversion (transliteration) of Serbian Cyrillic script to Latin and vice versa. It's a simple, user-friendly tool that can be useful for everyone working with Serbian text in different scripts, as well as those who are just beginning to learn Serbian.

## Features

-   **Bidirectional Transliteration**: Easily convert text from Latin to Cyrillic script and vice versa.
-   **Pleasant User Interface**: A straightforward and intuitive interface that simplifies the process of transliteration.
-   **Instant Conversion**: Real-time transliteration as you type.
